This is the online appendix for an industry study of testing highly configurable cyber-physical systems.
The appendix includes two **questionnaires**, and an **interview guide**, which was used in semi-structured interviews with 17 practitioners.


#### Abstract:

Cyber-physical systems, i.e., systems that seamlessly integrate computation and physical components, are typically highly-configurable systems. 
Testing such systems is particularly challenging because they comprise a large number of heterogeneous components that can be configured and combined in different ways. 
Despite a plethora of work investigating software testing in general and software product line testing in particular, variability in tests and how industry does actually manage testing highly configurable cyber-physical systems is not well understood. 
In this paper, we report the results of a multiple case study we conducted with four companies developing and maintaining highly-configurable cyber-physical systems focusing on their testing practices, with a particular focus on how they manage variability in tests. Based on the results of the multiple case study, to dig deeper, we conducted an interactive survey with experienced engineers from eight companies, four of which were part of the multiple case study. We use the results of the survey to reflect on the lessons learned from the multiple case study. 
We conclude that experienced-based selection of configurations for testing is currently predominant. 
Variability modeling techniques and tools are not utilized and the dependencies between configuration options are only partially modeled at best using custom artifacts such as spreadsheets or configuration files. 
However, the companies are aware of the situation and have the need and desire to cover more configuration combinations by automated tests. This in turn raises many questions interesting to the scientific community and motivating future research.
